## Responsive Design Breakpoints

## Form Validation (HTML5)

The contact form uses **built-in HTML5 validation** (no JavaScript needed):

```html
<!-- Example validations: -->
<input type="text" required>           <!-- Cannot be empty -->
<input type="email" required>          <!-- Must be valid email -->
<input type="tel" required>            <!-- Phone format -->
<input type="date" min="2025-11-09">   <!-- Future dates only -->
<select required>                      <!-- Must select option -->
```

**Browser will automatically**:
- Show error messages for empty required fields
- Validate email format
